These registry entries disable and enable telemetry in Windows 10.

The default-enabled Windows 10 telemetry feature set periodically sends usage and performance data to select Microsoft IP addresses. The 'Disable' entry turns off this feature and immediately stops any running telemetry services.

Use the 'Enable' entry to restore to default settings.
